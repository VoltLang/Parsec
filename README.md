### Parsec

Parsec is no longer being worked on, it has been replaced with
[volta.lib](https://github.com/VoltLang/Volta). Which is part
of the official Volt parser.

### Old info

Parsec is a parsing frontend for the
[Volt Programming Langauge](http://volt-lang.org). It is used by the
[Volt Language Server](https://github.com/VoltLang/Volt-Language-Server) and
other tools which processes the volt code.
